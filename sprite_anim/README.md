Trying out animating sprites. (Sprite is from the game Kid Chameleon.)

This demo taught me about:
- Changing the UV index of a sprite to achieve animation
- Achieving transparancy in a TIM file

I still haven't found out how to flip sprites, it seems like that's a lot more involved. It's much simpler on the SNES.
